# Kd-Trees 
A Java implementation of the [K-d Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) data structure.

Given an arbitrary set of points in `k`-dimensions, implement a data structure in which the runtime of range search and nearest-neighbor search is, on average, better than linear in the number of points.

In this implementation, `k = 2`.

An excellent discussion of the Kd-Tree data structure can be found at Princeton's [Algorithms and Data Structures, Part I](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html) website.

This project was completed for [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms).

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
