/**
 * This mutable data type represents a set of points in the "Unit Square".

 * Its representation depends on a Red-Black (balanced) Binary Search Tree,
 * hence O(log n) is expected for Searching, Inserting, and Deleting.
 * 
 * This particular implementation uses algs4.SET, although notably the same
 * implementation could be achieved through java.util.TreeSet.
 * 
 * More specifically, algs4.SET is a wrapper around java.util.TreeSet.
